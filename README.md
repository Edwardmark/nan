This project is about tensorflow implementation for paper attention-based template adaptation for face verification

2017/5/23 
start project, make an overall plan and design the algorithm
First, I decide to train a neural network end-to-end to do video face verification rather than separately as NAN paper.
My goal is to set up the new state-of-the-art result in IJB-A datasets.

Today's goal:
Design the neural network architecture based on mobilenet, which is light and good.

Today's review:
